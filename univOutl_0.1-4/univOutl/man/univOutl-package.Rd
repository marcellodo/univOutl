\title{
Detection of Univariate Outliers.
}
\description{
Well known outlier detection techniques in the univariate case. Ratios of two variables are covered too. When available, survey weights can be considered.
}
\details{
The package provides few simple functions implementing well known outlier detection techniques in the univariate case. 
Methods to deal with skewed distribution are included.
The Hidiroglou-Berthelot (1986) method to search for outliers in ratios of historical data is implemented as well. When available, survey weights can be used in outliers detection.
